# Personal project. 

Keywoard allows a user to enter a keyword of their choice, and then will generate a list of songs that go along with that keyword. From this list, users can choose which songs they know they don't and do like, as well as save songs that they don't know but want to listen to. These lists are saved for the user to reference later.
